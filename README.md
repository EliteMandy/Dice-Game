I have created a web-based lucky dice game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which can be accessed through a browser for an interactive experience. The game utilizes HTML for the structure of the website, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the dynamic behavior and game logic. Players can play the game through their browser, providing a convenient and user-friendly experience.
